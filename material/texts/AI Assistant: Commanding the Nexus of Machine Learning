"AI Assistant" is a ChatGPT created on the basis of a large-scale language model based on GPT-3 or its successor (e.g., GPT-4).GPT-3, known as "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3", is an advanced language processing AI model. Its ability to understand and generate natural language makes it very powerful and flexible in performing various text generation tasks
A large language model (LLM) is a deep learning algorithm that can perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. (Here is the command or prompt we enter in ChatGPT.) Large language models use transformer neural network.
